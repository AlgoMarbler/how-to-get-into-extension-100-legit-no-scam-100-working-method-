				Below are a few extremely easy ways to get into extended set and do your A-Levels in year 11 instead of holding onto the knowledge for another 4 years.
		</div>
		<div id="body-text">
				Step 1: Get >90% (90 is not sufficient) in your mock checkpoints. If you failed already, go to step 1b.
				<br><br>
				Step 1a) Get full marks for actual checkpoint maths. Move to step 1b if u failed (ARE U EVEN ASIAN?). Move to step 2 if u succeeded. 
				<br><br>
				Step 1b) Get full marks for first topic test of 2024. Move to step 1c if u failed (there‚Äôs no hope for u). Move to step 2 if u succeeded. 
				<br><br>
				Step 1c) write a 2000 word letter that won‚Äôt work to the head of department hoping he will read it despite the lack of evidence and the wanton pain on his mind for reading your hopeless literature. Move to step 2 if u failed. Move to step 250 if u succeeded bcs then that‚Äôs where u belong. üòä 
				<br><br>
				Step 2) contact head of department teacher using concise email outlining main points. Even better, is if u have steps 1, 1a, AND 1b which reinforces. If u happen to have failed all 3 then there‚Äôs no hope u will have to go to a public school and be a biologist at macdonalds. If failed, move to Step 2a, if successful then we‚Äôre done and you‚Äôve redeemed your Asianness. 
				<br><br>
				Step 2a) If contacting the teacher didn‚Äôt work and their reply happened to start with ‚ÄúThat will not be possible‚Ä¶‚Äù then ask your parents to talk to them. If your parents are not there then move to step ‚ÄòOrphan‚Äô and Step 2b await rescue. If successful then move to step ASIAN. 
				<br><br>
				Step 2b) If parent confrontation didn‚Äôt work then get more 100% in tests and ask friends (if any) to write letter to head of department. Hopefully determination will win through. If successful go to step ASIAN. If failed, go to step 250 and claim your trophy. 
				<br><br>
				Step 250) You are an idiot. 
				<br><br>
				Step ORPHAN) U have no parents 
				<br><br>
				Step ASIAN) u are a true Asian and will no longer have to face the terrible truth of not being in extension.
